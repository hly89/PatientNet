# PatientNet: a shiny web application for visualizing patient-specific cancer vulnerability networks 

## Introduction
PatientNet is part of drug combination prediction and testing (DCPT) platform developed by computational systems medicine group at FIMM, University of Helsinki (<https://www.fimm.fi/en/research/groups/aittokallio>). PatientNet constructs and visualizes patient-specific cancer vulnerability networks based on the patient-specific combination predictions. For each patient, the pathway cross-talk network is constructed by establishing the shortest paths that connect the selective drug targets of the predicted combinations to the patient-specific genetic aberrations and molecular changes, including mutated or dysregulated genes, through a comprehensive cancer signaling network from two large-scale studies. Users can also use PatientNet service at <https://pantientnet.fimm.fi>. 

##Usage
Data preparation: one single xlsx file with four sheets (Targets, DSS, Mutation, and Gene.exp) or four separate files containing the same data as one single xlsx file. Example data can be found:
